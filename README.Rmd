# tfboot

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tfboot is to facilitate statistical analysis of SNPs disrupting transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) using bootstrapping resampling to create empirical null distributions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tfboot from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with the code below. You'll need to replace `gh_pat` with your [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# First install devtools if you don't have it already
# install.packages("devtools")

# Set your personal access token
gh_pat="12345-abcde-CHANGEME-67890-xyz"

# Install directly from GitHub:
devtools::install_github(repo = "https://github.com/colossal-compsci/tfboot", 
                         auth_token = gh_pat, 
                         upgrade = FALSE, 
                         build_vignettes = TRUE, 
                         force = TRUE, 
                         dependencies = c("Imports", "Suggests"))
```

## Example

See the full introductory vignette with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("intro", package="tfboot")
```


This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(tfboot)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
